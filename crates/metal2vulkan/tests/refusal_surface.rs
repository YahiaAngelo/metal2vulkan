//! The refusal surface, and the basis of every refusal that claims Metal stops an input.
//!
//! `scripts/refusal-surface/refusal_surface.py` reads every typed refusal of the three published
//! crates from the sources and writes `docs/REFUSALS.md`. Its **Basis** column says where the
//! belief that an input must be refused comes from: derived from the construction site wherever the
//! site states it (a capability a device lacks, a piece not built, a cap of this crate's), and
//! declared in the refusal's own doc comment, as a last line `Basis: <value> (the evidence)`,
//! wherever the claim is about Metal itself, which no construction site can state.
//!
//! The runtime's `Problem` is nothing but such claims — every variant says Metal refuses, asserts,
//! answers nil or ends its process over an input — so every variant of it carries a declared
//! basis, and this test is what makes an absent or malformed one fail. A refusal whose basis is not
//! settled says `Basis: unknown (why)`: the project's rule is that unknown stays visible, not that
//! every row gets a green word.
//!
//! The vocabulary is one list, in the script: `metal-measured` and `metal-documented` (Metal itself
//! refuses, on a run of ours or on Apple's own words), `metal-takes` (measured: plain Metal takes
//! the input, so the refusal reaches past Metal — an open defect, recorded), `device`, `ours`,
//! `unknown`, and `delegated(ThatProblem)` for a variant that only forwards.
//!
//! # What it cannot see
//!
//! - Whether a citation is *true*. It holds a claim about Metal to carrying evidence that names a
//!   device or a release, never to that evidence being right.
//! - The problem enums `Problem` forwards to (`TextureProblem`, `CopyProblem`, `HeapProblem` and
//!   the rest): a `delegated` row says the claims live there, and the surface does not read them
//!   yet, so a new variant of one of those enums can still carry a bare assertion about Metal.
//! - The other seven sections' per-variant Metal claims. Their basis is derived from the
//!   constructor, which states the device axis and not Metal's answer; a declared `Basis:` line
//!   there is read and held to the vocabulary, and is not yet required.
