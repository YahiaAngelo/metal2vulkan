//! Blits between Apple's two-plane extended-range textures placed in a heap, ported from
//! `runtime_lane::two_plane_heap_blits`.
//!
//! The probe (`tph`): a placement heap of Metal's size, shared or private, every byte of it a byte
//! of the case's seed written through a buffer over the whole heap; two one-level 2D textures of
//! `RGB10A8_2P_XR10` or its sRGB twin placed where the probe placed them; one blit of the case's
//! region from one into the other; the heap's bytes read back through the buffer.
//!
//! **The split between the run shape and the bytes is deliberate, and it is the lane's.** Each
//! case holds two sites:
//!
//! - `runs`, a **typed** list of the runs the blit changed — each an offset and a length — which is
//!   what a blit-geometry bug moves: a copy that reads or writes the wrong rows, lands on the
//!   wrong plane, or strides by the wrong pitch changes *where* the bytes moved, and that shows in
//!   the run shape whatever the bytes are. This is 2,062 runs over the 25 cases, 23 KiB
//!   (`fixtures/public/two_plane_heap_blits/metal_runs.txt`), and it is the site a reader reads
//!   first.
//! - `bytes`, under a **digest alone**, because the moved bytes are 356 KiB and the probe printed
//!   the digest. Committing them would be fifteen times the measurement's size for a fact the run
//!   shape already localises, and the suite's record shape says a digest-only site compares by its
//!   digest and reports it as such — so the row never reads as exact over bytes nobody wrote down.
//!   Upgrading the site to raw bytes later needs no rewrite: the same site gains a value beside its
//!   digest.
//!
//! Metal's answer is **carried**: the two-plane extended-range formats are Apple's private ones
//! and Metal fills and places them through private API, so the Metal side has no public call to
//! record them from. The digests are the probe's, on an Apple M4 under macOS 27.0.1 (each blit
//! three times on the same bytes and every case twice, alike) and on an Apple M3 Max under macOS
//! 26.7, the same; the run shape was recovered on this M3 Max under MoltenVK, where every case's
//! recorded digest held. **The digests were not measured on this chip under this release**, which
//! the recording's provenance says in words.
