//! Kernel writes and reads of a texture of Apple's two-plane extended-range format.
//!
//! The owned fixture `xr_two_planes` writes a buffer's `half4` or `float4` values to a
//! `texture2d<half>`/`<float>` of `RGB10A8_2P_XR10` (or its sRGB twin) through `access::write`, and
//! reads the texture back through `access::read`, one thread per texel of a grid whose rows are `w`
//! texels apart, under 32 by 32 threadgroups. One case per format, each holding six outputs:
//!
//! - `half-written/*`: a 256 by 256 texture written with every `half` pattern in every channel
//!   (lane `c` of texel `n` holds `(n + 16384 c) mod 65536`), read back as `half4` and as `float4`;
//! - `float-written/*`: the same texture written with a dense `float` grid
//!   (`((n + 16384 c) mod 65536 - 32768) / 16384`), read back both ways;
//! - `consumer-shape/*`: the consumer's shape, a 64 by 4 texture under 2 by 1 threadgroups of
//!   32 by 32 — a 64 by 32 grid whose rows 4 to 31 are outside the texture — written with
//!   `0x3000 + n + 2048 c` and read back both ways.
//!
//! **What the port settles, and where it stops.** `runtime_lane::extended_range_two_planes` states
//! Metal's answer for these six outputs as six SHA-256 constants and nothing else, from a probe
//! whose numbers are gone. Two different things were in the way of recovering them, and only one of
//! them turned out to be real:
//!
//! - *Not* the format. The two-plane extended-range formats are not in Apple's public
//!   `MTLPixelFormat` list, and an earlier batch took that to mean the Metal side has no public
//!   call for them. It does: `MTLTextureDescriptor`'s pixel format is a raw value, and native Metal
//!   makes, writes and reads back a texture of 550 and 551 through entirely public calls. Record
//!   mode runs all six outputs on Metal, so every digest here is the oracle chip's own, taken by
//!   running the case.
//! - The size. The four 256 by 256 outputs are 65,536 threads of a `half4` or a `float4`, which is
//!   6 MiB of Metal's bytes across the two formats — more than belongs in a committed recording.
//!   Those four keep the digest, with a **window** of the first and the last 256 threads recorded
//!   whole beside it, so a failure at either end of the grid names the thread and the lane instead
//!   of only saying that the digest differs. The consumer's shape is 2,048 threads, so it is
//!   recorded whole.
//!
//! So the honest accounting is: four outputs are a digest plus a window and remain less informative
//! than raw values would be, and two are raw. All six are now Metal's measured answer on the chip
//! the suite names, rather than a digest from a probe on another machine.
//!
//! Nothing here can fault a GPU: compute passes of one kernel each, one texture and two buffers, no
//! loop and no sampling. The consumer's grid does reach past the texture, which is what the case is
//! about and what Metal defines: a write outside is dropped and a read outside answers zero.
